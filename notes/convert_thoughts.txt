Compress to JPEG 2000
convert -quality 90 INPUT -resize "1024x768>" OUT.jp2

convert -quality 90 INPUT -resize "PAR%x100%" -resize "1024x768>" OUT.jp2
in this example the PAR should be as a percent.
NTSC PAR of .9 should be 90
PAL PAR of 1.11111 should be 111.11111

-resize  :   Use > to change the dimensions of the image only if its width or height exceeds the geometry specification. < resizes the image only if both of its dimensions are less than the geometry specification. For example, if you specify 640x480> and the image size is 256x256, the image size does not change. However, if the image is 512x512 or 1024x1024, it is resized to 480x480. Enclose the geometry specification in quotation marks to prevent the < or > from being interpreted by your shell as a file redirection.

something like this:  -resize "1024x768>"
this should scale only images larger than 1024x768.  also it should keep the images in the proper aspect ratio
